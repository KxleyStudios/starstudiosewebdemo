                    <p>Kazz and Bibble are not real wizards. They failed every magic class, dropped out of school, and live in a moldy hill house with nothing to their names but ego and desperation. After accidentally completing a real wizarding job without using magic, they start a business offering magical services they are wildly unqualified for. Each job escalates in scale and danger, revealing cracks in their friendship…</p>

                    <h3>I'M SCARED OF ALOTTA STUFF</h3>
                    <p>I’m Scared of a Lot of Stuff is a supernatural comedy-horror series about a group of teens forced to face their fears when godlike beings turn anxiety, trauma, and insecurity into real monsters. It’s funny, messy, and emotional. Showing that bravery isn’t about being fearless, but about facing what scares you anyway.</p>
